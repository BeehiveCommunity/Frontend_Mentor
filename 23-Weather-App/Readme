# Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App** project! This is a beginner-friendly project designed to help you learn how to build and contribute to a simple web-based weather application.

## Features

- Search for the current weather in any city.
- Get details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Responsive design, works on both desktop and mobile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: For version control.
- **Node.js**: To run the app locally.
- **A Weather API key**: We use a third-party API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data. You'll need to sign up for a free account and get an API key.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an `.env` file** in the project root and add your Weather API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and **commit** them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: [description]"
   ```
4. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
5. **Create a pull request** from your branch to the main repository.
